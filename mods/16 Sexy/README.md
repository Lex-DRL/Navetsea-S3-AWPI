## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# `Sexy` edition

A special new torso for my skin, most suitable for slim and fit simmies.

A sexy ideal toned body, new pale lips, and new knee design, new neck post.

> I was editing female body when I got the idea to try the new female torso on male, after few adjustment and blending with the previous male torso, I found this new body is fantastic and brings more diversity to my skins.

Don't worry, those moles ^ are **NOT** part of the skin.
