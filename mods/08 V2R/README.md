Like [G.o.S](/mods/07%20G.o.S%20(Garden%20of%20Shadows)):
> A 2 in 1 skin set that will react to the color ramp. Designed to look good on female with smaller breasts. With a new color ramp.

Like [V2C](/mods/00%20ancient%20skins%20do%20not%20install/V2C):
> It is **an updated V2C skin** with my current skin features.

Like [Real 1](/mods/09%20Real%201):
> V2R is less muscular on the torso, its lips is a blend of my V2C with my new lips, it has new eyelids **that was developed for [Real 1](/mods/09%20Real1)**.

> Both (`V2R` & `Real 1`) are 2 in 1 skins and also have updated underboobs to support smaller breasted women, and foot and hand details, and also revised toddler body.
