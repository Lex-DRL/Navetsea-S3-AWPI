## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# `Real 1` edition

Also a 2 in 1 skin that reacts to the color ramp, Real 1 edition is distinctively different from all the previous releases.

It has almost totally new face that focuses more on being realistic looking. It might not be as smooth or young looking as other editions, but it has sweet small details and blushes that would make more unique sims with their flawed charm.

> It has all the latest updates of my skin including:
> * new eyelids,
> * foot and hand details,
> * revised toddler skin.

Like [V2R](/mods/08%20V2R):
> Both (`V2R` & `Real 1`) are 2 in 1 skins and also have updated underboobs to support smaller breasted women, and foot and hand details, and also revised toddler body.

> `Real 1` has more saggy cheek with a cute blush of pink across its face. `Real 1` chin is completely different than any of my previous. It has visibly much less underlips shadow so a thin lipped sim will look thin lipped.
