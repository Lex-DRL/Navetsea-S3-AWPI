## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# `Sweet` edition

A 2 in 1 skin, based on [Hot](/17%20Hot) and [Hairy v3](/18.2%20Hairy%20v3) editions.

### Common for `Sweet` and [Model](/20%20Model) editions:

- New lip again, with narrower mouth corner developed further from `Hairy v3` edition face.
- Less dark circle around eyes.
- Bigger nipple on male like the one used on [Bad](/18.1%20Bad) & [Hairy v3](/18.2%20Hairy%20v3) editions.
- Less moles and freckles, less body hair on legs and arms, so it looks clearer / smoother.
- New color ramp style to better use its 2in1 feature on wider color tones (click the preview pic below to read explanation about the new color ramp design). It can make caucasian, latin, vampire, and asian tones.

### Specific for `Sweet` edition:

- Blendable pubic hair for female from a neatly trimmed triangle to barely there fuzz.
