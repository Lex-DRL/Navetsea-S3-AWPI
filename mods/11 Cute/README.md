## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# `Cute` edition ❌

Also a 2 in 1 skin that reacts to the color ramp.

`Cute` edition is designed to make a realistically young sim, and also asian sim, using similar torso design of previous [Real 2](/mods/10%20Real%202) model. `Cute` edition is totally shaved - somewhat a more realistic version of [T.S.I (Asian)](/mods/05%20T.S.I%20(Asian)) & [Glam](/mods/02%20Glam) editions combined.

Tone wise, it has similar color ramp as [G.o.S (Garden of Shadows)](/mods/07%20G.o.S%20(Garden%20of%20Shadows)) edition, pale to dark+ alien.

> It has all the latest updates of my skin including:
> * new eyelids,
> * foot and hand details,
> * revised toddler skin.
