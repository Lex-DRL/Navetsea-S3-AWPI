## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# `Wild (Hairy) v2` edition ❌

> This new skin would be made as non default only, since it is more of a prototype of a concept.
> 
> Sometime a custom skin only have a light texture that blends into EA/default skin when the color ramp is dragged to the right. From that thought, I tried to make a 2 in one skin that would blend together into more unique look for different sims while using a same skin.
> 
> I make a hairy skin on a freckled body and face and set it to light, then I reduce the hair on some part, change the belly button, nipple, and moles and set it as dark, then I tried in game to play around with the color slider.
> 
> So I decide to publish it, to get input, and ideas to develop it further.
