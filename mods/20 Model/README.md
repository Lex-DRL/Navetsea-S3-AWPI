## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# `Model` edition

A 2 in 1 skin, based from on [Hot](/mods/17%20Hot) edition.

### Common for [Sweet](/mods/19%20Sweet) and `Model` editions:

- New lip again, with narrower mouth corner.
- Less dark circle around eyes.
- Bigger nipple on male like the one used on [Bad](/mods/18.1%20Bad) & [Hairy v3](/mods/18.2%20Hairy%20v3) editions.
- Less moles and freckles, less body hair on leg and arm.
- New color ramp style to better use its 2in1 feature on wider color tones (click the preview pic below to read explanation about the new color ramp design).

### Specific for `Model` edition:

- Naturally good looking, yet does not look like wearing permanent makeup.
- Smooth glowy skin with juicy lips.

> This edition also has a "futa" version of default-override mod. I.e., the one which adds male genitalia to female models.
