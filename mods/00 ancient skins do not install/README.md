## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# Ancient editions

- [Female](#female)
- [Male](#male)

## Naming
- `body MTS` = barbie crotch (male skin still would support penis mods if you use it)
- `body pubes` = with pubic hair & detailed for female
- `body shaved` = shaved for female
- `body hairy` = hairy body for male & detailed ready for Bloom's [CrammyBoy male genital addon](http://sexysims.info/download.php?t=172971).
- `face` = facial skin set
- `v1` = older uniform hue on the skin (more or less same hue all over the body)
- `v2` = newer more lively hue on the skin (delicate parts get a warmer hue than the not so delicate parts)

Comment on naming from Navetsea in original thread _(outdated)_:

> Later when I use the same hue to make alternate faces or body, I will use
v2a , v2b, v2c, and so on meaning the part would be compatible (hue/ skin color wise) with other v2 series to mix and match.
> 
> When I would make different hue (more gray, more brown, whatever) I will use v3, v4, and so on, so "v" stands for "variant" and not "version", so it doesn't mean v1 is obsolete when there is v2.
> 
> Finally when I do make considerably better skin in my opinion, I will make a new set named
F-IN02, F-IN03, F-IN04, and so on (until sometime I make it sounds more like a sport car naming than a skinset for simmies).
