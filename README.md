# **Navetsea**'s Sims 3 ArtWork Preservation Initiative

This repo is an attempt to preserve artwork by [Navetsea](https://navetsea.blogspot.com/) that was published as Sims 3 mods.

> __IMPORTANT__: This project uses Git [Large Files Support (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
> 
> Downloading a zip file using the corresponding link under green button on Github **WILL NOT WORK**. You must clone the project with a version of git that has LFS.

Downloading git-LFS repo with GitKraken: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S03EEusFxoI) _(I don't use GitKraken, not sure: you might need to install Git itself and Git LFS manually.)_

## MTSv
[ModTheSims](https://modthesims.info/d/479460) portal forbids publishing explicit content. So for it, `MTS` variants of the mods were made. They contain censored female trextures (crotch area is in barbie-style). Male textures are still full, since "that part" of texture can't be shown, unless a [corresponding additional mod by Cmar](http://sexysims.info/download.php?t=173718) is installed, too.

Full variants of mods are marked as `Adult` in their file name, censored are amrked as `MTSv`.

## Reasoning
There's a great 3D/Texture artist [Navetsea](https://navetsea.blogspot.com/) who has published a ton of custom character skintones in a form of mods for Sims 3. Unfortunately, they've published all their work so long ago that internet itself wasn't as developed back then. All the "official" download links in their blog are already dead by now, and what's published on other resources like [modthesims.info](https://modthesims.info/d/479460/face-in-revised-default-amp-non-default-natural-realistic-style-skin.html) is just a tiny fraction of what was created. Forum threads contain download links scattered over multiple forums, most of which are already dead, too. And those links that still work... Well, none of them contain _**ALL**_ the artwork in a single place.

So, before it's too late, this repo was created, to keep the amazing work.

## Disclaimer
In no way, shape or form the author of this repo takes credit for the artworks. As explicitly, stated, these mods were authored by [Navetsea](https://navetsea.blogspot.com/). And they were archived/recovered/shared by various users on community forums. [Credits](/CREDITS.md)
