Next, most of the credits go to [wapitawg](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/577239-wapitawg/) for collecting whatever they were able to find and [archiving it](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/177185-navetsea-face-in-skins-collection-25-skins-in-default-and-non-default-versions/).

The repo itself was created by [Lex-DRL](https://github.com/Lex-DRL).
