## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# `Glam revised` edition ❌

[Glam](/02%20Glam) edition got all the new details and seam fix, up to the [Tan](/12%20Tan) edition has, while maintaining its original smooth style.

> **IMPORTANT**:
> 
> This skin will replace the "old" Glam edition when installed.

When everything went well, it should replace sims who once used `Glam` skin into this new version. Otherwise you need a mod to bring your sim into CAS, like [nrass Master Controller](https://www.nraas.net/community/MasterController) and switch the skin manually.

> It has all the latest updates of my skin including:
> * new eyelids,
> * foot and hand details,
> * revised toddler skin,
> * _**armpit**_,
> * _**new lips**_,
> * _**belly button**_,
> * _**better detailed nipple**_.
