## _Navetsea's F-IN (Face-in) skin set_
# `Asian` edition

> A new first skin in 2013, for asian type simmies. This skin won't replace my older designated asian skin [T.S.I v2](/14%20T.S.I%20(Asian)%20v2%20(revised)) since I think both have enough differences to co-exist together.

A 2 in 1 skin:

- Full lip, with wide mouth corner.
- Asian type eye fold with dark under eyes.
- Smooth skin with less spots.
- Darker nipple and body hair.
- Less muscle on abdominal region.
- Double peaks color ramp style perfected to get deeper dark when needed.
